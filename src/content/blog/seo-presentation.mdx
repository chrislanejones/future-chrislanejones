Tonight I did a presentation for the [Richmond, VA WordPress Group](https://www.meetup.com/wordpressrva/). This is a new group that formed this year and this is the second presentation meeting thus far. I now lead the group's events on Meetup.com.

The event had a significant response of **27 attendees** and was hosted on Zoom. ChatGPT and how AI will affect SEO was the most requested question before the event. The event lasted around two hours.

## Reflection

Leading this presentation was an excellent opportunity to discuss one of the most pressing topics in web development today: the intersection of AI and SEO. The audience engagement was fantastic, and the two-hour session flew by as we explored how generative AI tools are reshaping content creation and search optimization strategies.

The overwhelming interest in AI's impact on SEO demonstrates how quickly our industry is evolving. It's an exciting time to be working in web development and digital marketing.
