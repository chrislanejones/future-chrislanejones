building websites.\n\nThis video production website portfolio helped me land my first job in tech, even though it referenced me being a video editor and web designer.\n\nI used a responsive theme to 
build my website, which was still a new concept in 2014. My first job in tech was at Web.com, and the majority of the websites were not responsive when I started.\n\nThis site was built with the 
CyberChimps Responsive WordPress theme—one of the early champions of mobile-first design in the WordPress ecosystem.",

major life and career transition. Looking back, it's a humbling reminder that not every design decision ages well. The Bootstrap grid was there, the functionality worked, but the aesthetic? Let's 
just say it was more 'functional' than 'beautiful.'\n\nDespite its appearance, this site served its purpose—it got me through contract work, networking events, and eventually led to better 
opportunities. It's proof that perfect is the enemy of done, and sometimes you just need to ship it and iterate later.",

WordPress's direction, particularly the controversies surrounding Matt Mullenweg and the platform's fractured ecosystem.\n\nThe block editor (Gutenberg) felt clunky compared to the elegance of React 
components. The WordPress drama was exhausting. And most importantly, I wanted the creative freedom that React offered—especially for animations and micro-interactions.\n\nReact with Framer Motion 
made it trivially easy to add smooth, performant animations that would have been painful in WordPress.\n\nThis site didn't last long. By mid-2025, I had fully transitioned to a modern React stack 
with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.",

animations smooth and intuitive. The component-based architecture meant I could build reusable pieces and iterate quickly. TypeScript caught bugs before they reached production. Tailwind made styling 
fast and consistent.\n\nThe bento grid layout, the smooth page transitions, the interactive components, the dark mode—all of this would have been significantly harder in WordPress. React gave me 
the tools to build the portfolio site I'd always envisioned.\n\nLooking ahead, I'm excited to continuing to push what's possible with modern web technologies. The journey continues.",
